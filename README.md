# PyWiCh

Python Wireless Channel Simulator.
Python is a widely used language and is also free software. To the best of our knowledge, no software to date allows simulating a wireless channel using standards such as 3gpp in Python. PyWiCh seeks to provide Python programmers interested in implementing wireless system simulation software using realistic channel models such as those proposed by 3gpp. In addition, it presents a graphical interface that allows simulations to be carried out in a friendly way and obtain results that can be used by academics and companies interested in this field. The objective is that PyWiCh can gradually increase its functionalities with the collaboration of the community interested in this topic.

## Getting started

The following packages must be installed with Python 3:
tkinter, numpy, matplotlib,scipy, unittest 

To run the software:

Create a local project directory to download the project.

Clone the project to the project directory.

If you are not in the project directory change your directory to the project directory.

Run:
python3 ./src/gui/gui_App_graph.py 

## User manual
The user manual explains how to use PyWiCh from its Graphical Interface. In addition, the manual describes how to use it from another Python program. The user manual also explains how to get the results of the simulations.
